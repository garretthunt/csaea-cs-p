# PYTHON RANDOM LIBRARY

# Python's library is a Pseudorandom Number Generator 

# Create your own pseudorandom number generator that utilizes a seed to output a random number. 
# The seed should be a floating-point number with five total digits (including those before and after the decimal), and it must be greater than 100.0. 
# Perform at least 3 different math calculations on it (ie, addition, subtraction, and division). 
# Use math library to round the float UP to an integer. 
# BONUS CHALLENGE: Make your random number output between 1 and 10.

# Challenge 2: Simulate a Die Roll
# Use the random library to simulate rolling a six-sided die.
# The output should be a random integer between 1 and 6.
# Store the result in a variable called "die_roll" and print it with a message.

# Challenge 3: Random Square Root
# Use random library to pick a number between 1 and 75. Store it in "num".
# Use math library to find its square root.
# Print the number, its square root, and the square root rounded UP with the math library.

# Challenge 4: Power Roll
# Roll two dice with the random library: one is the "base," one is the "exponent."
# Use math library to raise the base to the exponent. (ie, based to the POWer of exponent)
# Print both rolls and the result as an integer (hint: int() removes the .0).

exponent = random.randint(1,6)
